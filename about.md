As the title of this website indicates, my name is Loris Bergeron. I am passionate about new technologies whatever the domain, the language and the final objective of their use. 
I am convinced that sharing knowledge allows us to grow and move forward together and this is the leitmotiv of the existence of this website. 
I try to pass on some of my knowledge through short, concrete and playful articles and maybe bring you some help and/or arouse your personal curiosity. I believe deeply in the open-source philosophy but also in the themes of AI and Machine Learning.

A motto that characterises my daily work and thinking? It is, of course, the quote from Leonardo da Vinci: *&#8220;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&#8221;*

My academic background is varied. I have a Master's degree in *Computer Science (MSc)* and a Master's degree in *Business Administration (MBA)* from two French universities. The objective is very simple: create a double competence in order to give meaning to computer science by applying it to problems of the real professional world. 

Speaking of the professional aspect, my career path is both varied and atypical. I worked in a research center in the field of steel industry to develop solutions allowing the prediction of failure of industrial installations, I then created a FinTech specialized in the development of integrated IT solutions dedicated to Risk Management allowing the elaboration of financial risk reports for Luxembourg investment funds. 
Afterwards, I worked on the development of a computerized management tool for an international law firm specialized in the field of intellectual property, and I am now specialized in the field of humanitarian development cooperation.

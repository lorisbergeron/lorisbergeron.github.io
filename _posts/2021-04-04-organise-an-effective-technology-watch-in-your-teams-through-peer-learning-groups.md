For a long time I have tried, on a personal basis, to carry out an effective technological watch while trying to be as concise and efficient as possible in order to advance my skills. As you can probably imagine, this exercise requires a lot of energy and time outside of working hours, various time constraints and extra professional obligations that we all face.

One day the idea came to me to intelligently solve the problem I was facing to improve and boost my personal knowledge. While reading some articles dedicated to the self-learning of individuals, I came across a concept of Prof. Eric Mazur from Harvard University that was totally unknown to me until now. 

The approach is based on the concept of "Peer Instruction". This is a student-centered concept that reverses the traditional classroom to shift the transfer of information to the assimilation of information, or application of learning, in the classroom. It is from there that I wanted to transpose its concept to my real problem. More information here: [Harvard Magazine, Twilight of the Lecture](https://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/twilight-of-the-lecture)

In practice the result has been a real success and lies in the creation and development of collaborative workshops for my team on our work time. We call this approach: *Peer Learning Group*.

### What is peer learning group? 

The concept is very simple. It consists of learning workshops in the form of small groups whose objective is to carry out a technological watch or methodology that is user-friendly and efficient. The idea is to create a collective intelligence in order to discover or deepen a skill whatever the field in order to create an added value for all the participants. 

In these forms of workshops, the great novelty consists in the fact that there is no intervention from one or more trainers, it is one of the team members himself who ensures the presentation, the training and the explanations. 

Everyone can intervene during the workshop if the need arises, each member can then give and receive knowledge. 

### What are the advantages and challenges?

At this moment you are probably asking yourself: It sounds great, but what does it bring to my team? Rest assured, the advantages are many, diverse, and varied and respond to the modern problems of the business world. 

This learning format favors the spirit of collaboration between team members while creating cohesion. If we compare this approach with the so-called traditional approach that we all know, with a teacher and students, the students are simply "receivers" of knowledge and wait for the information to come to them. Needless to say, this traditional approach lacks interactivity and collaboration, and the point of view is only that of the one who delivers the knowledge to the others, namely the teacher. 

Unlike the traditional approach, the peer learning group approach is collaborative and has a much more dynamic energy due to the questions the team will generate during the knowledge exchange and presentation. 

It is important to note that mistakes are also allowed in this type of workshop, as the team is there to learn and discover new concepts but also to bring a critical eye to the information received. Remember that the primary objective is to learn and progress as a team. This learning becomes less strict and less stressful for the whole team.  

In a company, knowledge exchange is nothing new. We all do it between colleagues on a break, during a coffee or lunch, we exchange information and knowledge in an informal way. However, the implementation of these collaborative learning workshops formalizes and temporally segments the time dedicated to this transfer of knowledge. Moreover, despite the sad health situation we are going through, these workshops have the following advantage, the physical presence of the employees is optional.

Indeed, these workshops can take place in the company, in meeting rooms for example, or online via the use of computer and digital presentation and communication tools.

Another element to take into consideration is the absence of costs for the company (except for the cost of not having a part of the team present during a defined period of time). Internal self-learning means no costs for professional training, which can quickly cost up to several thousand euros per person.

Finally, a last element to be integrated into the reasoning is the one concerning the Human Resources aspect. The employee who spontaneously takes the initiative to organize the workshop will show motivation and dedication to prepare the transfer of knowledge to his colleagues. The other members of the team who participate in the workshop will receive this motivation in a transparent way, but above all they will feel fully involved in the life of the company and in their learning. 

### How to organize these peer learning groups?

These workshops cannot be improvised, on the contrary they must be anticipated and structured. It is necessary to identify a precise theme for the workshop which will interest the whole team but which will also bring an added value to the company by answering a problem frequently encountered in the professional activity.

Each team member should be free to organize a workshop of his choice. On the other hand, from experience I advise to limit the number of people present at the workshop to 10 people maximum in order to facilitate the exchanges.

It is reasonable to organize one workshop per month, making sure to rotate the person organizing the workshop to ensure a good balance within the team. In terms of duration, it is a good practice to organize this workshop for 60 to 90 minutes, both during technical meals or on Friday afternoons, in order to decompress from the week that has just passed. 

The format of the workshop can be based solely on the presentation of a visual support but can also combine a theoretical visual presentation and a technical demonstration part to stage the statements made in the first part of the workshop. The content and vocabulary should be adapted according to the people attending the workshop.

Always keep in mind to keep your participants engaged by regularly questioning them, making sure the message is clear, and inviting them to interrupt your explanations as needed. 

Once the presentation is over, feel free to share your presentation material, resources used during the workshop and additional external links for those who wish to learn more.
